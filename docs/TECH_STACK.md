# Tech stack

- `backend/`: FastAPI and SQLite. Every API operation has an `operation_id`, a one-line docstring and no optional inputs. Paying a claim is a separate operation that takes the amount.
- `agent/`: our own harness on LangChain's `create_agent` and its middleware, on OpenRouter, with no other agent framework. A queue agent works a run (one entry point that takes a run id) and hands each claim to a claim agent (one entry point that takes a claim id and a thread id). Both reach claims, documents and their instructions only through the backend's API. They use `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` with low reasoning effort by default, or the model in the environment variable `MODEL_NAME` if set, such as `openrouter/free`.
- `dashboard/`: React, Vite and TypeScript.
- `e2e/`: Playwright tests.
- `data/`: the business data the backend starts from, including our settings in `company.json` (the payout approval limit). The agent never sees `data/evals/`, which holds the answer key.

Python 3.12 with uv, all in the root `pyproject.toml`. Node 26. The OpenRouter key is `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`.
